\item{annex}{DBI connection to annex, to receive stochastic uploads.}

\item{modelling_group}{The modelling group id}

\item{disease}{The disease}

\item{touchstone}{The touchstone (including version) for these estimates}

\item{is_cohort}{Set this to TRUE if the csv file is cohort-oriented, or
FALSE for calendar-year oriented.}
